  We present a formal approach to reciprocal collision avoidance, where
  multiple independent mobile robots or agents need to avoid collisions with
  each other without communication among agents while moving in a common
  workspace. Our formulation, optimal reciprocal collision avoidance (ORCA),
  provides sufficient conditions for collision-free motion by letting each
  agent take half of the responsibility of avoiding pairwise collisions.
  Selecting the optimal action for each agent is reduced to solving a
  low-dimensional linear program, and we prove that the resulting motions are
  smooth. We test our optimal reciprocal collision avoidance approach on
  several dense and complex simulation scenarios workspaces involving thousands
  of agents, and compute collision-free actions for all of them in only a few
  milliseconds.

  RVO2-3D Library is an open-source C++98 implementation of our algorithm in
  three dimensions. It has a simple API for third-party applications. The user
  specifies agents and their preferred velocities. The simulation is performed
  step-by-step via a simple call to the library. The simulation is fully
  accessible and manipulable during runtime. The library exploits multiple
  processors if they are available using OpenMP for efficient parallelization
  of the simulation.

      We present an algorithm for collision-free navigation of multiple flying
      robots in three-dimensional workspace. Our approach extends the model of a
      simple car to a simple-airplane, which has constraints on speed and
      steering angle and includes a configuration variable for the altitude. We
      use a locally optimal reciprocal collision avoidance scheme that computes
      the trajectory without any collisions or oscillations for each airplane
      independently. In addition, our algorithm explicitly considers the
      kinematic and dynamic constraints of a simple-airplane and uses the notion
      of variable reciprocity when choosing velocities to ensure that
      simple-airplanes that are less constrained take more responsibility for
      avoiding collisions. We test our approach in two simulations and compute
      collision-free and oscillation-free trajectories that satisfy the kinematic
      and dynamic constraints of each simple-airplane.
